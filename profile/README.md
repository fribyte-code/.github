# Hello, welcome to friByte's GitHubðŸ‘‹

As you probably know, friByte is a student organization with the aim of running IT operations for other student organizations in Bergen, where we offer affordable web and IT services adapted to the student organizations.

This is something we have actually been doing ever since **24. February, 2002**, when a group of students from **E-tjenesten** wanted to start an organization that cultivated the operation of advanced IT systems.

## The goal of friByte

- Deliver secure, high-quality IT services to student organisations.
- Maintain an active learning environment for students interested in IT.
- Promoter for the ethical use of software and personal data.
- Be a contributor to the development and improvement of open and free software.
