# Guidelines for open source code in friByte

## Introduction

Welcome to friByte, a community dedicated 
to promote open source code. Our goal is to contribyte to technology developement through open, accessible and collaborative software development.

## Open source code

### Open source vs. Open standards

**Open source** refers to software whose source code is available for the public to use, modify and share. **Open standards**, on the other hand, are technical specifications available to everyone and can be used as a basis for software and services.

### Advantages of using open source code

By using open source, you can:

- Improve and adapt software to your own needs.
- Collaborate with a global community.
- Promote transparent and ethical software development.

### Improve code through transparency

Open source code contributes to better code quality through:

- Peer review and collaboration.
- Faster identification and correction of errors.
- Innovation through collective effort.

### Responsibility

As part of the friByte community, it is your responsibility to:

- Respect copyright and licenses.
- Contribute positively and constructively.
- Maintain an inclusive and respectful environment.

### Which repos should be open source?

As a basic principle, we want all repos to be open. But repos as "admin", should not be open as it contains names and various information that may be considered private. Otherwise, we have repo as "ctf-tasks" which is kept closed for a period as it contains answers to tasks.

But in general, everything can and should be open.

## Requirements to open repo under github.com/fribyte-code

All repositories under friByte must:

- Have clear and distinct licenses.
- Contain an informative README.
- Follow our guidelines for contributions and behaviour.

### License

Our projects are licensed under the MIT or GPL-3.0, both of which allow free use, modification and distribution, but with important differences. The MIT license is very flexible and only requires that the copyright text and license information be included with copies of the software. GPL-3.0, on the other hand, requires that all modified versions must also be distributed under the same license, which strengthens the requirement for open source.

### README

Each project must have a README file containing:

- Project description.
- Insallation and user guide.
- Contribution guidance.
